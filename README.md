# COSC3506-001XE
This repository is for developing a Project Software Engineering 


# **Project Guidelines**

## **Project Scope**
- Your project should focus on implementing the **core functionalities** of the assigned system.
- Ensure you understand the **problem statement** thoroughly and plan your approach accordingly.
- The system must incorporate **object-oriented design principles**, including:
  - **Classes & Objects**
  - **Inheritance**
  - **Encapsulation**
  - **Polymorphism**
  - **Abstraction**

## **User Roles & Access Control**
- Each project should include **at least three distinct user roles** (e.g., **Admin, Staff, Customer**) with different levels of access and permissions.
- Implement a **user authentication and authorization system** to ensure that users can log in and access only the features relevant to their roles.

## **Code Structure**
- Organize your code using **packages and classes** in a modular fashion.
- Separate functionality into different layers:
  - **Business Logic Layer**
  - **Data Access Layer**
  - **Presentation Layer**
- Follow **SOLID principles** and use **design patterns** where applicable to maintain **clean and scalable code**.

## **Database Integration**
- Your project should integrate with a **relational database** to store persistent data (e.g., users, transactions, inventory).
- Design and implement appropriate tables for different entities, ensuring proper relationships:
  - **One-to-Many**
  - **Many-to-Many**
- Use **JDBC (or an ORM framework)** to interact with the database for **CRUD operations**.

## **UI & User Interaction**
- Implement a **simple graphical user interface (GUI)** for user interaction.
- Ensure the **UI is intuitive and user-friendly**.
- Users should be able to **navigate between functionalities easily**, and actions (e.g., viewing data, updating records) should be clear.

## **Exception Handling & Validation**
- Implement **exception handling** to manage errors (**e.g., invalid input, database connectivity issues**) and prevent application crashes.
- Display **graceful error messages** to users.
- Validate all **user inputs** to ensure **data integrity**, such as:
  - **Required fields**
  - **Correct formats (e.g., email, phone numbers, dates)**

## **Testing**
- Write **unit tests** for core components of the application to ensure correctness.
- Test each **user role separately** to verify that permissions are correctly enforced.

## **Version Control**
- Use **Git** for version control.
- Regularly commit your code and write **meaningful commit messages**.
- Ensure your project is **well-documented**, including:
  - **README.md** file
  - **Installation steps**
  - **Usage instructions**

## **Documentation**
- Document your code with **comments**, explaining the purpose of each **class and method**.
- Provide a **brief architectural description** of the project, including **class diagrams** if necessary.

## **Team Collaboration (If Applicable)**
- Assign tasks clearly and ensure **effective communication** among team members.
- Use **collaborative tools** such as:
  - **GitHub** (for version control)
  - **Trello** (for task management)
  - **Slack/Discord** (for team discussions)
- Maintain a structured workflow to **merge code effectively** and track project progress.
